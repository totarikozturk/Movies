Understanding Tab Bar and Navigation Controller Understanding MVVM by separating logic between controller and view model Learning to implement table view Integrate third-party library Build UI programmatically in controller Using UserDefaults Integrate network layer by URLSession Using model(such as Movie) with Codable

**Architecture**

MVVM. Using protocols to pass the data from the network layer to the screen

**Language / Framework**

Swift with UIKit Responsive Design

Integrate SnapKit to build UI programmatically. No need to use any Storyboard or xib files Use table view in the list screen Download movie images via Kingfisher

**Logic**

The search and filter mechanism in the list screen must work without blocking UI Implement Codable to your Movie model and store movies as an array in a singleton object Store bookmarked movies in the UserDefaults as an array
